        A post-baccalaureate fellow establishing a controllable protein degradation 
        system in Drosophila ovarian somatic sheath cells to define the roles of key 
        pathway components and uncover what shapes piRNA populations over time.
        Outside the lab, I enjoy trying new coffee shops, watching basketball, and movies.

        Hi my name is Andrej and I'm a first-year postbac and incoming first-year medical
        student. In our lab, I'm currently looking into the function and efficacy of crucial auxiliary
        proteins in the piRNA pathway across different mammalian species. In my free time I like to go
        on hikes with my dog, skateboard, play sports, and watch movies.

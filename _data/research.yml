goal: >
  We aim to understand how small non-coding RNAs guard genomic integrity.
current_research: >
  Small non-coding RNAs play vital roles in development and disease by
  regulating gene expression, defending against viruses, and silencing mobile
  genetic elements (transposons). Our research focuses on PIWI-interacting
  RNAs (piRNAs), which safeguard genome integrity and are essential for germ
  cell health and fertility. To unravel the molecular mechanisms of this
  RNA-based immune system, we integrate genetics, genomics, and biochemistry.
  These studies deepen our understanding of the fundamental processes
  protecting genome integrity in animals and humans and inform molecular
  strategies for technological and therapeutic advances.
applying_research: >
  Maintaining genome stability is essential for cellular and organismal
  health, as its disruption is linked to diseases including infertility,
  inflammation, and cancer. Understanding RNA-guided genome protection opens
  paths for advancing fertility treatments and developing biomedical
  strategies to counteract genomic instability in disease.
need_for_study: >
  Small RNA-guided molecular machines are found across all domains of life,
  yet we are only beginning to understand their diverse roles in gene
  regulation and genome surveillance. Unraveling these pathways is essential
  for elucidating their functions in health and disease and will continue to
  expand the molecular toolkit for research and therapeutic applications.
plain_language: >
  Genomes serve as life’s instruction manuals, guiding cell, tissue, and organ
  formation. Protecting their integrity is crucial for fertility and species
  survival. Our research focuses on specialized molecular guardians that
  safeguard germ cell genomes in animals and humans. By uncovering these
  protective mechanisms, we aim to strengthen our understanding of genome
  stability and develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
